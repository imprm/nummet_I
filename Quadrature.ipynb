      "*Quadrature* is the term used for numerical evaluation of a definite integral, or put more simply, finding the area under a curve. There are a number of methods of quadrature which we will learn today. If we have a function $f(x)$ defined between $a$ and $b$, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral\">integral</a> is defined as \n",

      "\\end{equation}\n",
      "\n",
      "and its result is the area under the curve. As you know, this operation is an essential part of calculus, being the inverse of differentiation. Knowing the value of the area under a curve is  imporant to all kinds of applications. Many expressions are difficult to integrate, or the function which governs their shape is unknown, and we only have data. Therefore, no course on numerical methods is complete without discussing the different methods of numerical integration. A fundamental property of a definite integral is that\n",

      "\\end{equation}\n",
      "\n",
      "where $c$ is a point between $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we can perform an integration by splitting the function up into sections and summing the result of each integration. If the function is complicated or unknown, we can approximate its distribution between subdivisions and choose the size of subdivisions to get an accurate result. This is known as *adaptive quadrature*. In this lecture, five different quadrature methods will be covered in the context of a simple function: the Midpoint rule, Trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule, Composite Simpson's rule and Weddle's rule. Then, there is an excersise to apply numerical integration to a geophysical data set. \n",

The $\\sin \\left ( x \\right )$ function is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral\">known</a> to integrate to $-\\cos \\left ( x \\right )$, so we can integrate it ourselves by hand to find the true area under the curve:\n",
